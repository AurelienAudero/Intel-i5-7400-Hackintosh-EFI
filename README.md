This is an EFI Folder optimized for the setup specified below, you can use it for you Hackintosh.

It uses Clover as bootloader.

**‚ö†Ô∏è FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT [CONFIGURATION CHAPTER](https://github.com/AurelienAudero/i5-7400-EFI-by-Aure#configuration) BEFORE BOOTING ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**‚ö†Ô∏è This EFI is INCOMPATIBLE with macOS Big Sur** *If you want to use it, you need to upgrade to macOS Monterey 12.0 Beta (21A5248p)*

## Why i switched from Opencore to Clover

Clover provide more stability than Opencore for this system, Clover is a lot more user-friendly too and it's easier for you to create your EFI based on this one ([Legal details about creating your own EFI based on this one](https://github.com/AurelienAudero/i5-7400-EFI-by-Aure/blob/master/Share-LICENSE.md)).

With Clover, you can modify EFI using Clover Configurator with less risks of breaking a thing and FINALLY boot to Windows WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS üéâ

When you're first booting to this EFI Folder, you automatically agree to [The Terms and Conditions of Uses](https://github.com/AurelienAudero/i5-7400-EFI-by-Aure/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Fix Clock in Windows

When you're dualbooting a Linux-based Operating System or a macOS System with Windows, it can break the clock in Windows.

To fix that, you can modify a registry key in Windows Registry.

Go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation" and modify the DWORD value named "RealTimeIsUniversal" to "1".

If the the DWORD value "RealTimeIsUniversal" is not present in this directory, create a "DWORD (32-Bit Value) and call it "RealTimeIsUniversal" (case-sensitive).
